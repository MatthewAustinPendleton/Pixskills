To-Do:
	
	Now that we have a basic overlay system for the hair,
	the next thing we want to do is add:
		Eye Overlays!
	
	This will force me to have to come up with a system that handles not just
	the hair, but also the eyes, and potentially many other lays of
	overlays. 
	
	Currently thinking we will have:
		hair, eyes, hair, necklace, earrings, shoulder pads, arm overlays, hand
		overlays, rings, shirts and torso overlays, pants/leggings overlay, feet,
		cape overlays, hand equipped overlay, shield on back overlay
	
	Note: Hands and rings overlays will work differently, don't bother with those for now
	The hand will eventually be this extra thing that is added overtop the user graphic, 
	so I can move it separately along with the hand overlay and finger overlay and equipped
	overlays all together, making later animation easier and more amendable to programmatic
	solutions
